{"body":"## What you need\r\nAn account with Last.fm\r\nLast.FM API Key ([get here](www.last.fm/api/account))\r\nA Spotify Account (any type)\r\nMinimal Knowledge of CSS/HTML\r\nWebsite with Jquery enabled\r\n\r\n## Setting up\r\nSimply edit the last.fm.php and where you see\r\n`$user=\"\"\r\n$key=\"\"`\r\nYou add your username and your API key for last.fm (NOT Spotify)\r\n\r\nNext you'll need a simple Ajax in jQuery to access this as so:\r\n`<script>\r\n    \t$(document).ready(function(){\r\n    \t\t$.ajax({\r\n    \t\t\ttype: 'POST',\r\n    \t\t\turl: './last.fm.php',\r\n    \t\t\tdata: { request: 'true' },\r\n    \t\t\tsuccess: function(reply) {\r\n    \t\t\t\t$('.content').html(reply);\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t});\r\n    \t});\r\n    </script>`\r\n\r\nNow, all you need is a div or span setup to hold the content once its ready.\r\n`<div class=\"content\"><center><div style=\"padding-top:120px;\"><p><small>Loading...</small><br/><img src=\"./img/ajax/ajax-loader6.gif\"/></p></div></center></div>`\r\n\r\nIn my example, I use an ajax loading gif to hold the place. This isn't really needed but can be used as a fancy placeholder.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\nYou need to setup your Spotify account to \"scrobble\" to your last.fm account. This will share your activity to Last.FM. Once you do this, when someone loads your page, a request is sent to the LastFM servers where it returns the latest played songs, the script will then determine if its now playing or recent.\r\n\r\n## Results \r\n\r\nIf you last listened to a track (not in private session) over a day ago:\r\n_I last listened to Strobe by deadmau5 over a day ago on Spotify_\r\nIf you last listened to a track less than a day ago, but not current:\r\n_I last listened to Strobe by deadmau5 3 hours and 25 minutes on Spotify._\r\nIf you are currently listening to a track:\r\n_I am currently listening to Strobe by deadmau5 on Spotify._","note":"Don't delete this file!
